# Reflection

The GPT-3 website is a personal project built with the goal of deepening my understanding of React, BEM naming conventions, and overall UI/UX development.

This website is my first time implementing responsive UI/UX in React, and creating this project has helped me improve class naming conventions, writing clean React code, and tought me proper file structuring.

The technologies implemented in this website are React, and a significant amount of JSX and CSS. Figma was used for the design template. I used `create-react-app` because the boilerplate minimizes initial setup, and allows me to focus more on developing my code.
